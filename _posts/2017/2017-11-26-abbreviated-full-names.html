<blockquote>
  We carried out a family of controlled experiments to investigate
  whether the use of abbreviated identifier names, with respect to
  full-word identifier names, affects fault fixing in C and Java
  source code. This family consists of an original (or baseline)
  controlled experiment and three replications. We involved 100
  participants with different backgrounds and experiences in
  total. Overall results suggested that there is no difference in
  terms of effort, effectiveness, and efficiency to fix faults, when
  source code contains either only abbreviated or only full-word
  identifier names. We also conducted a qualitative study to
  understand the values, beliefs, and assumptions that inform and
  shape fault fixing when identifier names are either abbreviated or
  full-word. We involved in this qualitative study six professional
  developers with 1--3 years of work experience. A number of insights
  emerged from this qualitative study and can be considered a useful
  complement to the quantitative results from our family of
  experiments. One of the most interesting insights is that
  developers, when working on source code with abbreviated identifier
  names, adopt a more methodical approach to identify and fix faults
  by extending their focus point and only in a few cases do they
  expand abbreviated identifiers.
