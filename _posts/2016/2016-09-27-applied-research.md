> In this example-driven article Iâ€™ll discuss why applied research is a key enabler for impact, identify common vehicles for applied research, and argue for better metrics for scientific evaluation that measure both fundamental and applied contributions. Impacting the practice of software engineering is a huge challenge; it will require the best from our fundamental AND applied researchers.

David Shepherd is Senior Principal Scientist at ABB Corporate Research, leading their [Software Engineering Research Group](http://www.abb.com/softwareresearch). He argues that it is critical to think of impacting practice with one's research.

Books such as Roel Wieringa's ["Design Science Methodology"](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662438381) ([openly available intro here](http://bpm2015.q-e.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Roel-Wieringa.pdf)) have made similar points (in perhaps a more academic fashion): that software engineering "research" is really about a design cycle: learning from practitioners, devising a new artifact (tool, methodology, programming language) *and then* implementing and validating that artifact with the practitioners. If we look at the history of engineering and technology, many of the best advances come this way: powered flight is a good example of combining theoretical advances in airfoil and engine design with repeated trial and error. Walter Vincenti's book "[What Engineers Know and How They Know It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Engineers_Know_and_How_They_Know_It)" is a great overview of this.

Shepherd reports on some of the challenges his team have had transitioning useful sounding academic innovations, such as source code search, into mainstream practice. He calls these *applied research challenges*: for example, indexing speed requirements in real world applications can bring academic contributions to their knees.

While these applied research research challenges are critical to influencing practice, they are undervalued in academic circles. Shepherd concludes his post by arguing for a better system for valuing applied research contributions like source code releases, tool usages rates, and industry talks.

There are relatively few applied software research groups in industry settings: ABB Corporate Research, Microsoft Research, and the occasional paper from Google developers. There are two arguments to make in light of this. One is that the corporate overseers do not see great value in software engineering research. The second is that we as a community have done a poor job of showing that value. We can improve this by a renewed focus on applying research findings to industry problems.
